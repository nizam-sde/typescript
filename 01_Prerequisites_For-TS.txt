Differenciation between JavaScript and typescript

JavaScript is a dynamic single threaded logic based, interpreted scripting language mainly used for
web development, while TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type safety
and compiles down to JavaScript. TypeScript helps catch errors during development and is better
suited for large-scale applications, but all valid JavaScript code also works in TypeScript.

allowed vs not allowed ex - 

var userName = "Nizam"
var age = 21
var userName = "Nizam.ai"

in js it will not through error but ts does
because logically we should not re-declear a
name once decleared already, 

this type of mistakes present in js because
it was created in hurry within 15 days only
(type safety is missing in js)

var num = 12;
var num = "Nizam"; // type 'string' is not assognable in type 'number'. ts(2322)error

js won't complain about it but if it is a number then why we are assigning a name to it logically 
incorrect to do so

npm i typescript -g // to install typescript
sudo npm i typescript -g // to install typescript if above not worked
