-------- Type inference -----------

those datatypes which we have not decleared but TypeScript compiled
itself and checked its data type is called type inference

ex - let a = 12 ; //we have not decleared type of number here

----------------- Annotations-------------

declear its datatype in variables from very beginning is called Annotations.
ex - 
let a : number | boolean ;

a = 12;

****** Type of Annotations ex-

let a = boolean;

function abcd(a: number, b: string): void {}
